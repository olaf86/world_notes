# Firestore moderation and notices model

## Firestore instance

- Project: `world-notes-prod`
- Database: `(default)`
- Edition: `STANDARD`
- Type: `FIRESTORE_NATIVE`

## Existing paths touched by this work

- `users/{uid}`: owner-only profile document. Contains PII fields such as
  `email`; reads must remain owner-only.
- `users/{uid}/fcmTokens/{tokenId}`: server-only token store used by Cloud
  Functions for FCM delivery.
- `users/{uid}/notificationSettings/main`: owner-readable, server-writable.
- `places/{placeId}` and `places/{placeId}/messages/{messageId}`: messages are
  read only by users who can access the parent note.
- `places/{placeId}/messages/{messageId}/moderation/latest`: server-only
  provider scores and audit metadata for moderation decisions. For non-allow
  decisions, this also retains the submitted content for administrator review.
  Clients read only the derived message fields needed for UI.
- `reports/{reportId}`: currently client-created; planned to move behind a
  callable function in a later moderation phase.

## New path

- `users/{uid}/notices/{noticeId}`: app inbox items for moderation warnings,
  account restrictions, bans, report outcomes, and future developer messages.
  Owner may read and mark read. Creation, deletion, and content changes are
  server-only.

## Queries added

- `users/{uid}/notices.orderBy(createdAt desc).limit(100)`

This is a single-collection query scoped under the signed-in user, so no
composite index is expected.

## Rule requirement

- Require auth.
- Allow only the owner to read their notices.
- Allow only owner updates to `readAt`, because notice text/severity/action are
  authoritative server content.
- Deny client create/delete.
